Maintainer: David W. Roberts <droberts@montana.edu>
Description: Fuzzy set ordination is a multivariate analysis used in ecology to
    relate the composition of samples to possible explanatory variables.  While
    differing in theory and method, in practice, the use is similar to 'constrained
    ordination.'  The package contains plotting and summary functions as well as
    the analyses.
