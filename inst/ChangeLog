1) converted to NAMESPACE format

2) recoded some of the plotting routines to make them more flexible. 

3) made the thull executable local to fso rather than pulled from
   labdsv

4) tidied up the documentation



fso 1.2-0

1) I added a routine to look at 3-D MFSOs using the fabulous package rgl.

2) I also added a routine to do tensioned hulls on MFSOs.
